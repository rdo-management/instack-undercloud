      "message": "This makes the assumption that the reader is already familiar with HOT. I\u0027m not suggesting we re-invent the documentation for HOT, but I have a few suggestions:\n\n- A link to both HOT in general (somewhere in this series of patches, it may not apply here)\n\n- A description of what this snippet is trying to accomplish. I understand you\u0027re covering the mechanics of how to pass in a file like this, but it reads as if the intention is for the user to try to run this stuff (for example, the use of the cat/EOF). If that\u0027s the case, we should provide a brief explanation of what it is this snippet does (the echo call is pretty self-explanatory, but the rest of the guts around it could use some description), perhaps with links to things such as OS::Heat::MultipartMime",
