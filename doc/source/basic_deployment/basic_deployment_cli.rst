Basic Deployment (CLI)
======================

With these few steps you will be able to simply deploy RDO to your environment
using our defaults in a few steps.


Prepare Your Environment
------------------------

#. Make sure you have your environment ready and undercloud running:

   * :doc:`../environments/environments`
   * :doc:`../installation/installing`

#. Log into your undercloud (instack) virtual machine as non-root user::

    ssh root@<rdo-manager-machine>

    su - stack

#. In order to use CLI commands easily you need to source needed environment
   variables::

    source stackrc


Get Images
----------

.. note::

       If you already have images built, perhaps from a previous installation of
       RDO Manager, you can simply copy those image files into your regular user's
       home directory and skip this section.

       If you do this, be aware that sometimes newer versions of RDO Manager do not
       work with older images, so if the deployment fails it may be necessary to
       delete the older images and restart the process from this step.

       The image files required are::

           deploy-ramdisk-ironic.initramfs
           deploy-ramdisk-ironic.kernel
           discovery-ramdisk.initramfs
           discovery-ramdisk.kernel
           overcloud-full.initrd
           overcloud-full.qcow2
           overcloud-full.vmlinuz

Images must be built prior to doing a deployment. A discovery ramdisk,
deployment ramdisk, and openstack-full image can all be built using
instack-undercloud.

It's recommended to build images on the installed undercloud directly since all
the dependencies are already present.

The following steps can be used to build images. They should be run as the same
non-root user that was used to install the undercloud.


#. Choose image operating system:

   The built images will automatically have the same base OS as the
   running undercloud. To choose a different OS use one of the following
   commands (make sure you have your OS specific content visible):

   .. admonition:: CentOS
      :class: centos

      ::

          export NODE_DIST=centos7

   .. admonition:: RHEL
      :class: rhel

      ::

          export NODE_DIST=rhel7


#. Build the required images:

   .. only:: internal

      .. admonition:: RHEL
         :class: rhel

         Download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy it over from a different location,
         and define the needed environment variable for RHEL 7.1 prior to running
         ``openstack overcloud image build --all``::

             IMAGE=http://download.devel.redhat.com/brewroot/packages/rhel-guest-image/7.1/20150224.0/images/rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150224.0.x86_64.qcow2
             curl -O $IMAGE
             export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=`basename $IMAGE`
             # Enable RHOS
             export USE_DELOREAN_TRUNK=0
             export RHOS=1
             export DIB_YUM_REPO_CONF="/etc/yum.repos.d/rhos-release-7-director-rhel-7.1.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/rhos-release-7-rhel-7.1.repo"

   .. only:: external

    .. admonition:: RHEL
       :class: rhel

       Download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy it over from a different location,
       for example:
       https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.1/x86_64/product-downloads,
       and define the needed environment variables for RHEL 7.1 prior to running
       ``openstack overcloud image build --all``::

            export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150224.0.x86_64.qcow2

    .. admonition:: RHEL Portal Registration
       :class: portal

       To register the image builds to the Red Hat Portal define the following variables::

              export REG_METHOD=portal
              export REG_USER="[your username]"
              export REG_PASSWORD="[your password]"
              # Find this with `sudo subscription-manager list --available`
              export REG_POOL_ID="[pool id]"
              export REG_REPOS="rhel-7-server-rpms rhel-7-server-extras-rpms rhel-ha-for-rhel-7-server-rpms \
                  rhel-7-server-optional-rpms rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms"

    .. admonition:: RHEL Satellite Registration
       :class: satellite

       To register the image builds to a Satellite define the following
       variables. Only using an activation key is supported when registering to
       Satellite, username/password is not supported for security reasons. The
       activation key must enable the repos shown::

              export REG_METHOD=satellite
              # REG_SAT_URL should be in the format of:
              # http://<satellite-hostname>
              export REG_SAT_URL="[satellite url]"
              export REG_ORG="[satellite org]"
              # Activation key must enable these repos:
              # rhel-7-server-rpms
              # rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
              # rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
              # rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms
              export REG_ACTIVATION_KEY="[activation key]"

 .. note ::
    By default, images are built with the latest RDO-Manager Trunk repo which has passed CI. If you need to manually test packages before CI has passed, you can use:

    ::

      export DELOREAN_TRUNK_MGT_REPO="http://trunk-mgt.rdoproject.org/centos-kilo/current"

 ::

   openstack overcloud image build --all


 .. note::
    This script will build **overcloud-full** images (\*.qcow2, \*.initrd,
    \*.vmlinuz), **deploy-ramdisk-ironic** images (\*.initramfs, \*.kernel),
    **discovery-ramdisk** images (\*.initramfs, \*.kernel) and **testing**
    fedora-user.qcow2 (which is always Fedora based).


Upload Images
-------------

Load the images into the undercloud Glance::

    openstack overcloud image upload


Register Nodes
--------------

Register nodes for your deployment with Ironic::

    openstack baremetal import --json instackenv.json

.. note::
   It's not recommended to delete nodes and/or rerun this command after
   you have proceeded to the next steps. Particularly, if you start introspection
   and then re-register nodes, you won't be able to retry introspection until
   the previous one times out (1 hour by default). If you are having issues
   with nodes after registration, please follow
   :ref:`node_registration_problems`.

.. note::
   By default Ironic will not sync the power state of the nodes,
   because in our HA (high availability) model Pacemaker is the
   one responsible for controlling the power state of the nodes
   when fencing.  If you are using a non-HA setup and want Ironic
   to take care of the power state of the nodes please change the
   value of the "force_power_state_during_sync" configuration option
   in the /etc/ironic/ironic.conf file to "True" and restart the
   openstack-ironic-conductor service.

   Also, note that if "openstack undercloud install" is re-run the value
   of the "force_power_state_during_sync" configuration option will be
   set back to the default, which is "False".

Assign kernel and ramdisk to nodes::

    openstack baremetal configure boot


Introspect Nodes
----------------

Introspect hardware attributes of nodes::

    openstack baremetal introspection bulk start

.. note:: **Introspection has to finish without errors.**
   The process can take up to 5 minutes for VM / 15 minutes for baremetal. If
   the process takes longer, see :ref:`introspection_problems`.

Introspecting a single node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also introspect nodes one by one.
When doing so, you must take care to set the correct node states manually.
Use ``ironic node-show UUID`` command to figure out whether nodes are in
``manageable`` or ``available`` state. For all nodes in ``available`` state,
start with putting a node to ``manageable`` state::

    ironic node-set-provision-state UUID manage

Then you can run introspection::

    openstack baremetal introspection start UUID

This command won't poll for the introspection result, use the following command
to check the current introspection state::

    openstack baremetal introspection status UUID

Repeat it for every node until you see ``True`` in the ``finished`` field.
The ``error`` field will contain an error message if introspection failed,
or ``None`` if introspection succeeded for this node.

Do not forget to make nodes available for deployment afterwards::

    ironic node-set-provision-state UUID provide

Create Flavors
--------------

Create the necessary flavor::

    openstack flavor create --id auto --ram 4096 --disk 40 --vcpus 1 baremetal
    openstack flavor set --property "cpu_arch"="x86_64" --property "capabilities:boot_option"="local" baremetal

Configure a nameserver for the Overcloud
----------------------------------------

Overcloud nodes need to have a configured nameserver so that they can resolve
hostnames via DNS. The nameserver is defined in the undercloud's neutron
subnet. Define the nameserver to be used for the environment::

    # List the available subnets
    neutron subnet-list
    neutron subnet-update <subnet-uuid> --dns-nameserver <nameserver-ip>

.. note::
   A public DNS server, such as 8.8.8.8 can be used if there is no internal DNS
   server.

.. admonition:: Virtual
   :class: virtual

   In virtual environments, the libvirt default network DHCP server address,
   typically 192.168.122.1, can be used as the overcloud nameserver.

Deploy the Overcloud
--------------------

   By default 1 compute and 1 control node will be deployed, with networking
   configured for the virtual environment.  To customize this, see the output of::

        openstack help overcloud deploy

   .. admonition:: Ceph
      :class: ceph

      When deploying Ceph it is necessary to use the regular Heat templates
      instead of Tuskar, to specify the number of Ceph OSD nodes to be
      deployed and to provide some additional parameters to enable usage
      of Ceph for Glance, Cinder, Nova or all.
      Make a copy of the file ``/usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/storage-environment.yaml``
      and edit it as appropriate, then pass the following additional arguments::

          --ceph-storage-scale <number of nodes> --templates -e /path/to/customized/storage-environment.yaml

      to the deploy command below.

      By default when Ceph is enabled the Cinder LVM back-end is disabled. This
      behavior may be changed by also passing::

          --cinder-lvm

   .. admonition:: RHEL Satellite Registration
      :class: satellite

      To register the Overcloud nodes to a Satellite add the following flags
      to the deploy command::

             --rhel-reg --reg-method satellite --reg-org <ORG ID#> --reg-sat-url <satellite URL> --reg-activation-key <KEY>

      .. note::

          Only using an activation key is supported when registering to
          Satellite, username/password is not supported for security reasons.
          The activation key must enable the following repos:

          rhel-7-server-rpms

          rhel-7-server-optional-rpms

          rhel-7-server-extras-rpms

          rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms

   .. note::

       The deployment defaults to using kvm as a virtualization library.
       If your compute nodes are virtual machines, this ends up having
       nested ``kvm`` engines which is not recommended. Therefore you should
       on a virtual install use ``qemu`` as a virtualization library instead
       by adding the following to the deploy command::

          --libvirt-type=kvm

   ::

      openstack overcloud deploy --templates

.. note::

       To deploy the overcloud with network isolation, bonds, and/or custom
       network interface configurations, instead follow the workflow here to
       deploy: :doc:`../advanced_deployment/network_isolation`

Post-Deployment
---------------


Access the Overcloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``openstack overcloud deploy`` generates an overcloudrc file appropriate for
interacting with the deployed overcloud in the current user's home directory.
To use it, simply source the file::

    source ~/overcloudrc

To return to working with the undercloud, source the stackrc file again::

    source ~/stackrc


Setup the Overcloud network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initial networks in Neutron in the Overlcoud need to be created for tenant
instances. The following are example commands to create the initial networks.
Edit the address ranges, or use the necessary neutron commands to match the
environment appropriately. This assumes a dedicated interface or native VLAN::


    neutron net-create nova --router:external --provider:network_type flat \
      --provider:physical_network datacentre
    neutron subnet-create --name nova --disable-dhcp \
      --allocation-pool start=172.16.23.140,end=172.16.23.240 \
      --gateway 172.16.23.251 nova 172.16.23.128/25

The example shows naming the network "nova" because that will make tempest
tests to pass, based on the default floating pool name set in nova.conf. You
can confirm that the network was created with::

    neutron net-list
    +--------------------------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | id                                   | name        | subnets                                               |
    +--------------------------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | d474fe1f-222d-4e32-802b-cde86e746a2a | nova        | 01c5f621-1e0f-4b9d-9c30-7dc59592a52f 172.16.23.128/25 |
    +--------------------------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

To use a VLAN, the following example should work. Customize the address ranges
and VLAN id based on the environment::

    neutron net-create nova --router:external --provider:network_type vlan \
      --provider:physical_network datacentre --provider:segmentation_id 195
    neutron subnet-create --name nova --disable-dhcp \
      --allocation-pool start=172.16.23.140,end=172.16.23.240 \
      --gateway 172.16.23.251 nova 172.16.23.128/25


Validate the Overcloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To verify the Overcloud by running Tempest::

    openstack overcloud validate --overcloud-auth-url $OS_AUTH_URL \
                                 --overcloud-admin-password $OS_PASSWORD

.. note:: The full Tempest test suite might take hours to run on a single CPU.

To run only a part of the Tempest test suite (eg. tests with ``smoke`` tag)::

    openstack overcloud validate --overcloud-auth-url $OS_AUTH_URL \
                                 --overcloud-admin-password $OS_PASSWORD \
                                 --tempest-args smoke


Redeploy the Overcloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The overcloud can be redeployed when desired.

#. First, delete any existing Overcloud::

    heat stack-delete overcloud

#. Confirm the Overcloud has deleted. It may take a few minutes to delete::

    # This command should show no stack once the Delete has completed
    heat stack-list

#. Although not required, introspection can be rerun::

    openstack baremetal introspection bulk start

#. Deploy the Overcloud again::

    openstack overcloud deploy --templates
