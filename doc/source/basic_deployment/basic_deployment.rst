Basic Deployment
================

With these few steps you will be able to simply deploy RDO to your environment
using our defaults in a few steps.


Prepare Your Environment
------------------------

#. Make sure you have your environment ready and undercloud running:

   * :doc:`../environments/environments`
   * :doc:`../installation/installing`

#. Log into your undercloud (instack) virtual machine as non-root user::

    ssh root@<rdo-manager-machine>

    su - stack

#. In order to use CLI commands easily you need to source needed environment
   variables::

    source stackrc


Get Images
----------

Images must be built prior to doing a deployment. A discovery ramdisk,
deployment ramdisk, and openstack-full image can all be built using
instack-undercloud.

It's recommended to build images on the installed undercloud directly since all
the dependencies are already present.

The following steps can be used to build images. They should be run as the same
non-root user that was used to install the undercloud.


#. Choose image operating system:

   The built images will automatically have the same base OS as the
   running undercloud. To choose a different OS use one of the following
   commands (make sure you have your OS specific content visible):

   .. admonition:: CentOS
      :class: centos

      ::

          export NODE_DIST=centos7

   .. admonition:: RHEL
      :class: rhel

      ::

          export NODE_DIST=rhel7


#. Build the required images:

   .. only:: internal

      .. admonition:: RHEL
         :class: rhel

        Download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy it over from a different location,
        and define the needed environment variable for RHEL 7.1 prior to running
        ``instack-build-images``::

             curl -O http://download.devel.redhat.com/brewroot/packages/rhel-guest-image/7.1/20150203.1/images/rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150203.1.x86_64.qcow2
             export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150203.1.x86_64.qcow2
             # Enable rhos-release
             export RUN_RHOS_RELEASE=1

   .. only:: external

    .. admonition:: RHEL
       :class: rhel

       Download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy it over from a different location,
       for example:
       https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.1/x86_64/product-downloads,
       and define the needed environment variables for RHEL 7.1 prior to running
       ``instack-build-images``::

            export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150224.0.x86_64.qcow2

    .. admonition:: RHEL Portal Registration
       :class: portal

       To register the image builds to the Red Hat Portal define the following variables::

              export REG_METHOD=portal
              export REG_USER="[your username]"
              export REG_PASSWORD="[your password]"
              # Find this with `sudo subscription-manager list --available`
              export REG_POOL_ID="[pool id]"
              export REG_REPOS="rhel-7-server-rpms rhel-7-server-extras-rpms rhel-ha-for-rhel-7-server-rpms \
                  rhel-7-server-optional-rpms rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms"

    .. admonition:: RHEL Satellite Registration
       :class: satellite

       To register the image builds to a Satellite define the following
       variables. Only using an activation key is supported when registering to
       Satellite, username/password is not supported for security reasons. The
       activation key must enable the repos shown::

              export REG_METHOD=satellite
              # REG_SAT_URL should be in the format of:
              # http://<satellite-hostname>
              export REG_SAT_URL="[satellite url]"
              export REG_ORG="[satellite org]"
              # Activation key must enable these repos:
              # rhel-7-server-rpms
              # rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
              # rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
              # rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms
              export REG_ACTIVATION_KEY="[activation key]"

   ::

          instack-build-images


   .. note::
      This script will build **overcloud-full** images (\*.qcow2, \*.initrd,
      \*.vmlinuz), **deploy-ramdisk-ironic** images (\*.initramfs, \*.kernel),
      **discovery-ramdisk** images (\*.initramfs, \*.kernel) and **testing**
      fedora-user.qcow2 (which is always Fedora based).


#. Load the images into Glance::

    instack-prepare-for-overcloud


Register Nodes
--------------

Register nodes for your deployment with Ironic::

    instack-ironic-deployment --nodes-json instackenv.json --register-nodes

.. note::
   It's not recommended to delete nodes and/or rerun this command after
   you have proceeded to the next steps. Particularly, if you start discovery
   and then re-register nodes, you won't be able to retry discovery until
   the previous one times out (1 hour by default). If you are having issues
   with nodes after registration, please follow
   :ref:`node_registration_problems`.


Introspect Nodes
----------------

Introspect hardware attributes of nodes::

    instack-ironic-deployment --discover-nodes

.. note:: **Introspection has to finish without errors.**
   The process can take up to 5 minutes for VM / 15 minutes for baremetal. If
   the process takes longer, see :ref:`introspection_problems`.


Create Flavors
--------------

Create the necessary flavors::

    instack-ironic-deployment --setup-flavors


Deploy the Overcloud
--------------------

.. admonition:: Baremetal
   :class: baremetal

   Copy the sample overcloudrc file and edit to reflect your environment. Then source this file::

      cp /usr/share/instack-undercloud/deploy-baremetal-overcloudrc ~/deploy-overcloudrc
      source deploy-overcloudrc

Deploy the overcloud (default of 1 compute and 1 control):

.. admonition:: RHEL Satellite Registration
   :class: satellite

   To register the Overcloud nodes to a Satellite define the following
   variables. Only using an activation key is supported when registering to
   Satellite, username/password is not supported for security reasons. The
   activation key must enable the repos shown::

          export REG_METHOD=satellite
          # REG_SAT_URL should be in the format of:
          # http://<satellite-hostname>
          export REG_SAT_URL="[satellite url]"
          export REG_ORG="[satellite org]"
          export REG_ACTIVATION_KEY="[activation key]"
          # Activation key must enable these repos:
          # rhel-7-server-rpms
          # rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
          # rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
          # rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms

.. admonition:: Ceph
   :class: ceph

   When deploying Ceph, specify the number of Ceph OSD nodes to be deployed
   with::

       export CEPHSTORAGESCALE=1

   By default when Ceph is enabled the Cinder iSCSI back-end is disabled. This
   behavior may be changed by setting the environment variable::

       export CINDER_ISCSI=1

::

    instack-deploy-overcloud --tuskar

.. admonition:: Without Tempest
      :class: no-tempest

    By default ``instack-deploy-overcloud`` runs an integration test suite
    against the deployed overcloud. To avoid that, run::

        instack-deploy-overcloud --tuskar --no-tempest


Post-Deployment
---------------


Access the Overcloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``instack-deploy-overcloud`` generates an overcloudrc file appropriate for
interacting with the deployed overcloud in the current user's home directory.
To use it, simply source the file::

    source ~/overcloudrc

To return to working with the undercloud, source the stackrc file again::

    source ~/stackrc


Redeploy the Overcloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The overcloud can be redeployed when desired.

#. First, delete any existing Overcloud::

    heat stack-delete overcloud

#. Confirm the Overcloud has deleted. It may take a few minutes to delete::

    # This command should show no stack once the Delete has completed
    heat stack-list

#. Although not required, introspection can be rerun::

    instack-ironic-deployment --discover-nodes

#. Deploy the Overcloud again::

    instack-deploy-overcloud --tuskar
