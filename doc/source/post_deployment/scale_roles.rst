Scaling Overcloud Roles
=======================
If you want to increase or decrease resource capacity of a running overcloud,
you can start more servers of a selected role or delete some servers if
capacity should be decreased. First update the Overcloud plan with a new
number of nodes of the role::

    openstack management plan set $PLAN_UUID -S Compute-1=5

.. note::
   The role is specified including the role version. Both role names
   and role versions can be listed with command::

       tuskar role-list


And then re-deploy the Overcloud with the updated plan::

    openstack overcloud deploy --plan-uuid $PLAN_UUID

.. note::
   Scaling out assumes that newly added nodes has already been
   registered in Ironic.

.. note::
   When scaling down random servers of specified role will be deleted, how to
   delete specific nodes is decribed in :ref:`delete_nodes`.
