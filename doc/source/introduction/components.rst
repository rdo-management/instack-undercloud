Node Management
---------------
ironic
^^^^^^

Ironic project is responsible for provisioning and managing bare metal
instances.

For testing purposes Ironic can also be used for provisioning and managing
virtual machines which act as bare metal nodes via special driver ``pxe_ssh``.

**How to contribute**

Ironic uses `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ to manage the
development environment, see `OpenStack's Documentation
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic/dev/contributing.html>`_,
`Ironic Developer Guidelines
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic/Developer_guidelines>`_
and `OpenStack Developer's Guide`_ for details.

ironic-discoverd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ironic-discoverd project is responsible for discovery of hardware properties
for newly enrolled nodes (see also ironic_). Ironic uses drivers to hide
hardware details behind a common API.

**How to contribute**

ironic-discoverd uses `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ to manage
the development environment, see `upstream documentation
<https://github.com/stackforge/ironic-discoverd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_

os-net-config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deployment Planning
-------------------
Tuskar
^^^^^^
The Tuskar project is responsible for planning of deployments through the use
of two main concepts: Role (unit of functionality, e.g. 'Compute') and Plan.
A given Role is associated with a number of Heat templates and extra
data files and Tuskar allows the user to provide values for a Role's template
attributes.

Once a Plan is specified in terms of Roles (and any desired
template attributes have been set) Tuskar can assemble and generate the
corresponding Heat deployment files and return these to the caller
(ready to be passed to Heat).

**How to contribute**

The Tuskar project uses the usual OpenStack code review process with gerrit
reviews (see links below). Tuskar is a sub-project falling under TripleO
and as such you can use the #tripleo irc channel (freenode) or the weekly
TripleO meeting to bring up issues about Tuskar, as well as the openstack-dev
mailing list of course.

Deployment & Orchestration
--------------------------
heat
^^^^

Heat is OpenStack's orchestration tool. It reads YAML files describing
the OpenStack deployment's resources (machines, their configurations
etc.) and gets those resources into the desired state, often by
talking to other components (e.g. Nova).

**How to contribute**

* Use `devstack with Heat
  <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/getting_started/on_devstack.html>`_
  to set up a development environment. Submit your changes via
  OpenStack Gerrit (see `OpenStack Developer's Guide
  <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_).

**Useful links**

* Upstream Project: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat
* Bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/heat
* Blueprints: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/heat

heat-templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The heat-templates repository contains additional image elements for
producing disk images ready to be configured by Puppet via Heat.

**How to contribute**

* Use `devtest with Puppet
  <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-incubator/puppet.html>`_
  to set up a development environment. Submit your changes via
  OpenStack Gerrit (see `OpenStack Developer's Guide
  <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_).

* Bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/heat-templates
* Blueprints: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/heat-templates

tripleo-heat-templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tripleo-heat-templates describe the OpenStack deployment in Heat
Orchestration Template YAML files and Puppet manifests. The templates
are processed through Tuskar and materialized into an actual
deployment via Heat.

**How to contribute**

* Use `devtest with Puppet
  <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-incubator/puppet.html>`_
  to set up a development environment. Submit your changes via
  OpenStack Gerrit (see `OpenStack Developer's Guide
  <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_).

* Bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo
* Blueprints: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo

nova
^^^^
TBD

puppet-\*
^^^^^^^^^

The OpenStack Puppet modules are used to configure the OpenStack
deployment (write configuration, start services etc.). They are used
via the tripleo-heat-templates.

**How to contribute**

* Use `devtest with Puppet
  <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-incubator/puppet.html>`_
  to set up a development environment. Submit your changes via

tripleo-puppet-elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tripleo-puppet-elements describe the contents of disk images which
RDO-Manager uses to deploy OpenStack. It's the same kind of elements
as in tripleo-image-elements, but tripleo-puppet-elements are specific
for Puppet-enabled images.

**How to contribute**

* Use `devtest with Puppet
  <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-incubator/puppet.html>`_

python-openstackclient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The python-openstackclient is an upstream CLI tool which can manage multiple
openstack services. It wraps openstack clients like glance, nova, etc. and maps
them under intuitive names like openstack image, compute, etc.

The main value is that all services can be controlled by a single (openstack)
command with consistent syntax and behaviour.

* python-openstackclient uses `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
  to manage the development environment, see `upstream documentation
  <https://github.com/openstack/python-openstackclient/blob/master/README.rst>`_
  for details. Submit your changes via OpenStack Gerrit
  (see `OpenStack Developer's Guide`_).

* Human interface guide: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-openstackclient/humaninterfaceguide.html

python-rdomanager-oscplugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The python-rdomanager-oscplugin is a CLI tool embedded into
python-openstackclient. It provides functions related to instack
installation and initial configuration like node discovery, overcloud image
building and uploading, etc.
