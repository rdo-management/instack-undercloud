Architecture
------------

With RDO-Manager, you start by creating an **undercloud** (an actual operator
facing deployment cloud) that will contain the necessary OpenStack components to
deploy and manage an **overcloud** (an actual tenant facing workload cloud). The
overcloud is the deployed solution and can represent a cloud for any purpose
(e.g. production, staging, test, etc). The operator can choose any of available
Overcloud Roles (OpenStack components) they want to deploy to his environment.

few other open sourced plugins which are increasing RDO-Manager capabilities.
