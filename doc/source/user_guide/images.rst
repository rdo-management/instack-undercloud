Building images
---------------

Images must be built prior to doing a deployment. A discovery ramdisk,
deployment ramdisk, and openstack-full image can all be built using
instack-undercloud.

It's recommended to build images on the installed undercloud directly since all
the dependencies are already present.

The following steps can be used to build images. They should be run as the same
non-root user that was used to install the undercloud.

#. The built images will automatically have the same base OS as the running
   undercloud. See the Note below to choose a different OS::

  .. note:: To build images with a base OS different from the undercloud,
     set the ``$NODE_DIST`` environment variable prior to running
     ``instack-build-images``:

     .. admonition:: CentOS
        :class: centos

       * CentOS: ``export NODE_DIST=centos7``
       * RHEL 7.1: ``export NODE_DIST=rhel7``


#. Build the required images:

   .. only:: internal

      .. admonition:: RHEL
         :class: rhel

         Download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy it over from a different location,
         and define the needed environment variable for RHEL 7.1 prior to running
         ``instack-build-images``::

             curl -O http://download.devel.redhat.com/brewroot/packages/rhel-guest-image/7.1/20150203.1/images/rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150203.1.x86_64.qcow2
             export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150203.1.x86_64.qcow2
             # Enable rhos-release
             export RUN_RHOS_RELEASE=1

   .. only:: external

      .. admonition:: RHEL
         :class: rhel

         Download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy it over from a different location,
         for example:
         https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.1/x86_64/product-downloads,
         and define the needed environment variables for RHEL 7.1 prior to running
         ``instack-build-images``::

             export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150224.0.x86_64.qcow2
             export REG_METHOD=portal
             export REG_USER="[your username]"
             export REG_PASSWORD="[your password]"
             export REG_POOL_ID="[pool id]"   # Find this with `sudo subscription-manager list --available`
             export REG_REPOS="rhel-7-server-rpms rhel-7-server-extras-rpms rhel-ha-for-rhel-7-server-rpms \
                 rhel-7-server-optional-rpms rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms"

          instack-build-images


   .. note::
      This script will build **overcloud-full** images (\*.qcow2, \*.initrd,
      \*.vmlinuz), **deploy-ramdisk-ironic** images (\*.initramfs, \*.kernel),
      **discovery-ramdisk** images (\*.initramfs, \*.kernel) and **testing**
      fedora-user.qcow2 (which is always Fedora based).


#. Load the images into Glance::

    instack-prepare-for-overcloud


.. note::

   If you followed Getting Started flow, after images are loaded to Glance :ref:`go back to the flow <post_building_images>`.
