Building Images
===============

Images must be built prior to doing a deployment. A discovery ramdisk,
deployment ramdisk, and openstack-full image can all be built using
instack-undercloud.

It's recommended to build images on the installed undercloud directly since all
the dependencies are already present.

The following steps can be used to build images. They should be run as the same
non-root user that was used to install the undercloud.

#. The built images will automatically have the same base OS as the running
   undercloud. See the Notes below to choose a different OS::

  .. note:: To build imageswith a base OS different from the undercloud,
     set the ``$NODE_DIST`` environment variable prior to running
     ``instack-build-images`` commands::

        # To choose CentOS 7:
        export NODE_DIST=centos7
        # To choose RHEL 7.1:
        exoprt NODE_DIST=rhel7

  .. note:: If building images for **RHEL 7.1**, download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy
     it over from a different location, and define the needed environment variable
     to use the image prior to running the above ``instack-build-images`` commands::

        curl -O http://download.devel.redhat.com/brewroot/packages/rhel-guest-image/7.1/20150203.1/images/rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150203.1.x86_64.qcow2
        export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150203.1.x86_64.qcow2

2. Build the required images::

    instack-build-images

#. Load the images into Glance::

    instack-prepare-for-overcloud
