Building Images
===============

Images must be built prior to doing a deployment. A discovery ramdisk,
deployment ramdisk, and openstack-full image can all be built using
instack-undercloud.

It's recommended to build images on the installed undercloud directly since all
the dependencies are already present.

The following steps can be used to build images. They should be run as the same
non-root user that was used to install the undercloud.

#. The built images will automatically have the same base OS as the running
   undercloud. See the Note below to choose a different OS::

  .. note:: To build images with a base OS different from the undercloud,
     set the ``$NODE_DIST`` environment variable prior to running
     ``instack-build-images``:

     .. admonition:: CentOS
        :class: centos-tag

        ::

            export NODE_DIST=centos7

     .. admonition:: RHEL
        :class: rhel-tag

        ::

            export NODE_DIST=rhel7

2. Build the required images:

   .. only:: internal

     .. admonition:: RHEL
        :class: rhel-tag

        Download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy it over from a different location,
        and define the needed environment variable for RHEL 7.1 prior to running
        ``instack-build-images``::

             curl -O http://download.devel.redhat.com/brewroot/packages/rhel-guest-image/7.1/20150203.1/images/rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150203.1.x86_64.qcow2
             export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150203.1.x86_64.qcow2
             # Enable rhos-release
             export RUN_RHOS_RELEASE=1

   .. only:: external

    .. admonition:: RHEL
       :class: rhel-tag

       Download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy it over from a different location,
       for example:
       https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.1/x86_64/product-downloads,
       and define the needed environment variables for RHEL 7.1 prior to running
       ``instack-build-images``::

            export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150224.0.x86_64.qcow2

    .. admonition:: RHEL Portal Registration
       :class: portal-tag

       To register the image builds to the Red Hat Portal define the following variables::

              export REG_METHOD=portal
              export REG_USER="[your username]"
              export REG_PASSWORD="[your password]"
              # Find this with `sudo subscription-manager list --available`
              export REG_POOL_ID="[pool id]"
              export REG_REPOS="rhel-7-server-rpms rhel-7-server-extras-rpms rhel-ha-for-rhel-7-server-rpms \
                  rhel-7-server-optional-rpms rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms"

    .. admonition:: RHEL Satellite Registration
       :class: satellite-tag

       To register the image builds to a Satellite define the following
       variables. Only using an activation key is supported when registering to
       Satellite, username/password is not supported for security reasons. The
       activation key must enable the repos shown::

              export REG_METHOD=satellite
              # REG_SAT_URL should be in the format of:
              # http://<satellite-hostname>
              export REG_SAT_URL="[satellite url]"
              export REG_ORG="[satellite org]"
              # Activation key must enable these repos:
              # rhel-7-server-rpms
              # rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
              # rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
              # rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms
              export REG_ACTIVATION_KEY="[activation key]"
              export REG_HALT_UNREGISTER=""
   ::

          instack-build-images


   .. note::
      This script will build **overcloud-full** images (\*.qcow2, \*.initrd,
      \*.vmlinuz), **deploy-ramdisk-ironic** images (\*.initramfs, \*.kernel),
      **discovery-ramdisk** images (\*.initramfs, \*.kernel) and **testing**
      fedora-user.qcow2 (which is always Fedora based).

#. Load the images into Glance::

    instack-prepare-for-overcloud
