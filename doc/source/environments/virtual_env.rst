Virtual Environment
===================

RDO-Manager can be deployed in a virtual environment using virtual
machines instead of actual baremetal. However, one baremetal machine is still
needed to act as the host for the virtual machines.


Minimum System Requirements
---------------------------
To deploy a minimal RDO cloud with RDO-Manager you need the following virtual
machines:

* 1 Undercloud VM (where RDO-Manager lives)
* 1 Overcloud Controller
* 1 Overcloud Compute

Each virtual machine must consist of at least 4GB of memory and 40GB of disk
space [#]_.

The baremetal machine must meet the following minimum system requirements:

* Virtualization hardware extenstions enabled (nested KVM is not supported)
* 1 quad core CPU
* 12GB free memory
* 120GB disk space

For minimal **HA (high availability)** deployment you need at least 3 Overcloud
Controllers which increases the minimum system requirements up to:

* 20GB free memory
* 200GB disk space.


Preparing the Virtual Environment
---------------------------------

#. Install RHEL 7.1 Server x86_64 or CentOS 7 x86_64 on your host machine.

   .. only:: external

     .. admonition:: RHEL
        :class: rhel-tag

        Register the host machine using Subscription Management::

            sudo subscription-manager register --username="[your username]" --password="[your password]"
            # Find this with `subscription-manager list --available`
            sudo subscription-manager attach --pool="[pool id]"
            # Verify repositories are available
            sudo subscription-manager repos --list
            # Enable repositories needed
            sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms \
                 --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms \
                 --enable=rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms

#. Make sure sshd service is installed and running.
#. The user performing all of the installation steps on the virt host needs to
   have sudo enabled. You can use an existing user or use the following commands
   to create a new user called stack with password-less sudo enabled. Do not run
   the rest of the steps in this guide as root.

    * Example commands to create a user::

        sudo useradd stack
        sudo passwd stack  # specify a password
        echo "stack ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/stack
        sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/stack

#. Make sure you are logged in as the non-root user you intend to use.
#. Download and execute the instack-undercloud setup script:

   .. only:: internal

      .. admonition:: RHEL
         :class: rhel-tag

          Enable rhos-release::

              export RUN_RHOS_RELEASE=1

   ::

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdo-management/instack-undercloud/master/scripts/instack-setup-host | bash -x

#. Install instack-undercloud::

    sudo yum install -y instack-undercloud

#. The virt setup automatically sets up a vm for the Undercloud installed with
   the same base OS as the host. See the Note below to choose a different
   OS.:

  .. note:: To setup the undercloud vm with a base OS different from the host,
     set the ``$NODE_DIST`` environment variable prior to running
     ``instack-virt-setup``:

     .. admonition:: CentOS
        :class: centos-tag

        ::

            export NODE_DIST=centos7

     .. admonition:: RHEL
        :class: rhel-tag

        ::

            export NODE_DIST=rhel7

8. Run the script to setup your virtual environment:

   .. only:: internal

     .. admonition:: RHEL
        :class: rhel-tag

        Download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy it over from a different location,
        and define the needed environment variables for RHEL 7.1 prior to running
        ``instack-virt-setup``::

             curl -O http://download.devel.redhat.com/brewroot/packages/rhel-guest-image/7.1/20150203.1/images/rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150203.1.x86_64.qcow2
             export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150203.1.x86_64.qcow2
             export DIB_YUM_REPO_CONF=/etc/yum.repos.d/rhos-release-6-rhel-7.1.repo

   .. only:: external

     .. admonition:: RHEL
        :class: rhel-tag

        Download the RHEL 7.1 cloud image or copy it over from a different location,
        for example:
        https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.1/x86_64/product-downloads,
        and define the needed environment variables for RHEL 7.1 prior to running
        ``instack-virt-setup``::

            export DIB_LOCAL_IMAGE=rhel-guest-image-7.1-20150224.0.x86_64.qcow2
            export REG_METHOD=portal
            export REG_USER="[your username]"
            export REG_PASSWORD="[your password]"
            # Find this with `sudo subscription-manager list --available`
            export REG_POOL_ID="[pool id]"
            export REG_REPOS="rhel-7-server-rpms rhel-7-server-extras-rpms rhel-ha-for-rhel-7-server-rpms \
                rhel-7-server-optional-rpms rhel-7-server-openstack-6.0-rpms"

   .. admonition:: Ceph
      :class: ceph-tag

      To use Ceph you will need at least one additional virtual machine to be
      provisioned as a Ceph OSD; set the ``NODE_COUNT`` variable to 3, from a
      default of 2, so that the overcloud will have exactly one more::

          export NODE_COUNT=3

   ::

      instack-virt-setup

   If the script encounters problems, see :doc:`../troubleshooting-virt-setup`.

When the script has completed successfully it will output the IP address of the
instack vm that has now been installed with a base OS.

Running ``sudo virsh list --all`` [#]_ will show you now have one virtual machine called
*instack* and 4 called *baremetal[0-3]*.

You can ssh to the instack vm as the root user::

        ssh root@<instack-vm-ip>

The vm contains a ``stack`` user to be used for installing the undercloud. You
can ``su - stack`` to switch to the stack user account.

Continue with :doc:`../install-undercloud`.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#]  Note that some default partitioning scheme will most likely not provide
    enough space to the partition containing the default path for libvirt image
    storage (/var/lib/libvirt/images). The easiest fix is to customize the
    partition layout at the time of install to provide at least 200 GB of space for
    that path.

.. [#]  The libvirt virtual machines have been defined under the system
    instance (qemu:///system). The user account executing these instructions
    gets added to the libvirtd group which grants passwordless access to
    the system instance. It does however require logging into a new shell (or
    desktop environment session if wanting to use virt-manager) before this
    change will be fully applied. To avoid having to re-login, you can use
    ``sudo virsh``.
